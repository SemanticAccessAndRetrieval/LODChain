# LODChain

Here, you can find the code for the web application LODChain.

LODChain (https://demos.isl.ics.forth.gr/LODChain/) is a service that can help a provider to strengthen the connections between his/her datasets and the rest datasets. LODChain finds the common entities, schema elements and triples among the dataset at hand and hundreds of LOD Datasets and through equivalence reasoning it suggests to the user various inferred connections, as well as related datasets. In addition, it detects erroneous mappings, and offers various content-based dataset discovery services, for enabling the enrichment of datasets’ contents.
